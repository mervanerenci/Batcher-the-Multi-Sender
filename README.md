# Batcher
Batcher is a solution built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables the efficient and cost-effective transfer of ERC20 tokens to multiple recipients in a single transaction . This project addresses the need for a streamlined method of distributing tokens to a large number of addresses, saving time and reducing gas costs associated with individual transfers.

## Features
- Supports any ERC20 token.
- Allows sending tokens to an arbitrary number of recipients with different amounts.
- Allows sending from multiple senders to multiple recipients with different amounts.
- Ensures atomicity of transfers, preventing partial transfers in case of errors.
